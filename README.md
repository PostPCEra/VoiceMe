Flask Tutorial -- good one: 
 + covers step by step of each topic : [Templates, Forms, Ajax, etc..](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-ii-templates)
 + In this tutorial  having 'app' folder and 'router.py', __init__.py is confusing, so just juse one file for routes and to start/run server.
